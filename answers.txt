If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

Using the dataset's audio features (danceability, energy, valence), I would compute the averages across the listener's top 100 songs:

  AVG(danceability), AVG(energy), AVG(valence)

If those averages are high (for example, > 0.6–0.7), the listener's audio aura would be energetic and danceable with positive valence (happy/upbeat). If averages are low (< 0.4), the aura would be calmer, less energetic, and more melancholic. The three averages give a 3-dimensional summary that can be described using short phrases such as "high-energy, high-danceability, positive" or "low-energy, low-valence, introspective."

Why this simple calculation might not be representative:

1. Top-100 bias: the file only contains the listener's *most-played* songs. Top tracks overrepresent repeat listens of a few favorites and underrepresent the long tail of occasional listening. If the listener repeatedly played a small set of upbeat songs, the averages skew energetic even if they occasionally listen to quiet music.

2. Popularity bias: songs in the top 100 globally (or the dataset) may reflect mainstream production values (compressed loudness, high danceability) rather than the user's full taste.

3. No weighting by play counts: treating all 100 songs equally ignores the difference between a song played 50 times vs. one played twice.

4. Missing contextual metadata: there is no per-track play timestamp, track-level mood tags, or listening context (workout vs. study). Also no per-listen duration — a skipped track counts the same as a full play in the top-100.

5. Limited features: danceability / energy / valence are useful but do not capture lyrical content, genre, tempo changes, or instrumentation that affect mood.

Better approaches I would propose:

1. Weight averages by play counts or total listening time (stronger signal from frequently played tracks).
   - Example SQL to get raw averages: `SELECT AVG(danceability), AVG(energy), AVG(valence) FROM songs;`
   - Better: if you have a plays table, compute weighted averages: `SUM(feature * plays) / SUM(plays)`.

2. Use clustering (k-means) or dimensionality reduction (PCA) on more features (tempo, loudness, speechiness, key, duration) to find dominant listening clusters (e.g., "dance-pop", "chill indie", "rap/hip-hop").

3. Add time windows and sessions: compute separate auras for morning/evening or by month to reflect seasonality and context.

4. Use classification / embedding models trained on playlists labeled with moods to map a listener’s track embeddings to higher-level mood labels.

5. Report distributions, not only means: include medians and quartiles to show whether the listener samples from a narrow or wide range of moods.

In short: the simple average of danceability, energy, and valence gives a quick rough “audio aura”, but more representative measures would weight by play counts, consider temporal/contextual splits, and use more features and models to produce richer, more robust aura descriptions.
